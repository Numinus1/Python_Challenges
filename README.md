# Python_Challenges
Python scripts created while learning Python and certain algorithms:
1. Created a script to randomly generate an N-Puzzle problem (n decided by user) and solve it using the A* Algorithm
2. Created a script to generate a random N-Queens problem (n decided by user) and solve it using the Hill Climbing Algorithm
3. Created a script for Human vs AI TicTacToe; the AI uses the Minimax Algorithm

There is also a trial.py script that was created to play around with and better understand some basic Python features and syntax
